* A Letter to You All

**Dear students,**

Thank you for choosing to study for the course of C programming language. In the following lessons, I'd like to call it as "C language" or "C" for the sake of easy reading.

Now, let us begin with a quick introduction to this course. Our aim is to show the details of  the programming language by the C, such as data type, variables and control flow. So this course is essential and important, I'm looking forward that you can listen and make notes carefully in class and do some exercises after class. 

I hope that this course can make you love writing code and we can be good friends.Enjoy your learning time. 

Ready? Let's go!
